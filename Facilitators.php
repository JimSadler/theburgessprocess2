                <p class="container-paragraphs">Martha Burgess Novak has a unique roadmap which
                    takes you from awareness to consciousness to the enlightened life that is yours
                    for the choosing. It is unlike any healing journey you have ever experienced. By
                    releasing you once and for all from habitual emotional clutter and circular
                    thinking, you are freed from the hold of the past to move fully into your
                    dynamic present. Here you find deep levels of peace, compassion and forgiveness
                    for yourself and others. Here you begin to live the powerful and ever-expanding,
                    abundant life that is yours in the fullness of God.</p>
                <p class="container-paragraphs">It is here in the fullness of God, where you
                    live your life in complete authenticity. In advanced stages of consciousness,
                    you experience the enlightened life, free from anxiety and fear. Instead, your
                    life is filled with ever increasing joy, passion and potential. You live your
                    truth, you know that you are limited by nothing, you know that you are pure,
                    creative potential as your mind is sharply focused to create the life you want.</p>
                <p class="container-paragraphs">If this sounds too good to be true, you do not
                    know Martha. Martha is a powerful spiritual teacher, healer, and emotional
                    intuitive who, over her lifetime, has developed a life-changing system of
                    training, not only for business, but also for spirituality in every aspect of
                    daily life. It is called The Burgess Process and it teaches that everything is
                    the spiritual journey.</p>

                        Master Facilitator in the Burgess Process. With a lifelong interest in human
                        behavior and a sincere desire to help others achieve their goals, she found the
                        Burgess Process to be the most effective technique for getting to the root of
                        what is blocking the way to true, lasting change. From a young age, she
                        discovered she had a natural intuition for reading other people's emotions as
                        well as an innate ability to see behavioral patterns. She is grateful her
                        training in psychology and the Burgess Process has given her the tools to
                        utilize these gifts to be of service to others. Full of compassion for each
                        client's individual journey, Christina has a passion for helping the client
                        navigate his or her own unique system of wiring to reveal the potential within.</p>

                        All my life I’ve been searching for answers, even as a child. Somewhere inside
                        of me, I knew life had more love, joy, happiness, peace, and fulfillment in
                        store for me than I have ever allowed.
                        <br>
                        While I had accomplished things in life, nothing was ever enough. I read books,
                        meditated, investigated different religions but nothing filled my emptiness. At
                        age 56, my life as I had known it changed. My 35 year marriage and business
                        partnership was over. In the chaos of this, I was miraculously led to Martha
                        Burgess Novak (then Martha Burgess) who presented me with the questions I needed
                        to be asking and the new answers I needed to be considering.
                        <br>
                        I have been studying with her now for almost ten years. She does not train her
                        people lightly and I have studied hard. Two years ago, I was privileged to
                        become one of her master healers and facilitators.
                        <br>
                        I now use my experience in retail, entrepreneurship, and personal relationships
                        to help others on their journey.</p>

                        in marketing and advertising for 30 years. Tracy has always been interested in
                        consciousness studies as an avid reader and researcher, but true clarity was not
                        found until she attended a Leadership Program at AT&T where Martha Burgess Novak
                        spoke. Tracy recognized Martha immediately as her teacher and started weekly
                        sessions with her as well as participating in years of study in healing and
                        spiritual development classes. Tracy now works full time as an intuitive and
                        healing facilitator with Martha and works daily to be a clear channel for
                        herself and her clients. With the tools Tracy has to share with you, all things
                        are possible.
