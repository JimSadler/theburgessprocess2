          <span class="s1"> We continue our series on "Happiness Through Authenticity." It's a dynamic series and we
            hope you are enjoying it.
            <br><br>

            All Martha's shows are archived on Blog Talk Radio, Facebook Live and YouTube so do please check out past
            shows. We also encourage you to form study groups around these shows to support your journey. Thank you so
            much for following Martha,
            befriending her (Martha Novak on FB), sharing these shows, and liking them. Your kindness in taking time to
            do these things increases
            our number of listeners and helps get the word around. We appreciate it!

          for iPhones that is only .99 and extremely fun to use).

      <p>Hello, everyone! We would like our community to know each other. Please do send in a picture of who is
        listening to our show,
        first names only. It can be you, a group of friends, and/or your pets but let's all see each other! We will post
        them to a new
        "Community Page" and keep in mind that, if you send them in, you are giving us permission to use them on this
        page. Keep them clean,
        ladies and gentlemen, because anything that isn't gets deleted and Martha will never see them. But show us your
        beautiful, conscious
        selves as you listen to this show on Sunday mornings and let's participate with each other this way.
        <br>
