                    <h4>Sharing on Facebook</h4>
                    <p class="p1"><span class="s1">
                        The Facebook SDK does not allow a pre population of text to a post. The text has to be written in the moment. Sharing these quotes on Facebook is still possible however by
                        copying and then pasting the text into the Facebook post window.
