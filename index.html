It is unlike any healing journey you have ever experienced. By releasing you once and for all from habitual emotional clutter and circular thinking, you are freed from the hold of the past to move fully into your dynamic present. Here you find deep levels of peace, compassion and forgiveness for yourself and others. Here you begin to live the powerful and ever-expanding, abundant life that is yours in the fullness of God.</p>
<p class="container-paragraphs">It is here in the fullness of God, where you live your life in complete authenticity. In advanced stages of consciousness, you experience the enlightened life, free from anxiety and fear. Instead, your life is filled with ever increasing joy, passion and potential. You live your truth, you know that you are limited by nothing, you know that you are pure, creative potential as your mind is sharply focused to create the life you want.</p>
<p class="container-paragraphs">If this sounds too good to be true, you do not know Martha. Martha is a powerful spiritual teacher, healer, and emotional intuitive who, over her lifetime, has developed a life-changing system of training, not only for business, but also for spirituality in every aspect of daily life. It is called The Burgess Process and it teaches that everything is the spiritual journey.</p></div>

Many of us have had extraordinary experiences where we've glimpsed this reality -- mystical peeks behind the ordinary, life-threatening moments that alter us forever, or a moment in nature of profound communion. The many revelations in this book take you behind the appearance of things, into the workings of energy and a radical perspective on the way things truly are. Call it enlightenment, greater consciousness or living in grace, it is a potential available to all.</p>
<p>Martha Burgess Novak’s “The Life You Want” delves into the subject of greater consciousness and extraordinary, untapped human potential. This book will dismantle your old, limited beliefs about the nature of who you are, the possibility of real love, and will give you answers from the perspective of how you use your energy to perpetuate the past rather than create a truly different present and future. It will lead you to a new understanding of deeper realities which can actually be seen and understood, realities which are hidden beneath the surface of human relationships and beneath every person's struggle to find meaning and happiness.</p>
<p>The author has a unique capacity for translating complex concepts, offering practical approaches which you can immediately incorporate. She takes the stories of everyday life showing us how we trap our energies as we hold onto the past, secured to the beliefs we conjured as children, remaining energetically hostage to images and ideas that were never even ours to begin with. Only when we bring our energy into the present, do we live our lives passionately, joyously, creatively and far more lovingly according to our true nature. You can purchase Martha's book now on amazon.com, kindle.com or at The Phoenix and Dragon Bookstore in Sandy Springs,GA.!</p></div>

                                <p class="editable" id="untitled-region-20">This is a broadcast class. You may take it online or in person.</p>
                             <p class="editable" id="untitled-region-21">The emphasis of this class is on the deeply psychological wiring of the ego and the egoic child's mind. We analyze, facilitate healing, uncover deeply buried, convoluted beliefs that limit us and help each other grow, change and become authentic as the spiritual beings in physical form we are. This class teaches and inspires and the vastness of The Burgess Process and the varied techniques and powerful processes are revealed in this class. We say "over time" because we have a mass of material to cover, there's no way it can begin to be covered in one class, and this is why this is an on-going class for the serious student of consciousness. Each quarter we pick up where we left off and each quarter we go deeper into more esoteric, applicable study.</p>
                                    <p class="editable" id="untitled-region-22">It is possible for eager format students to audit this class. Be advised, however, this is a class we recommend you work up to through the other class offerings and your private sessions.</p>

                <div class="col-lg-12 editable" id="untitled-region-23"><p class="container-paragraphs">She is a trustworthy and fearless guide for me on my journey to consciousness, with unwavering dedication to truth and lasting, positive change. Martha lives the simple, yet profound, message conveyed through her work. She has an extraordinary ability to bring ascended information and energy through to be integrated and experienced in the lives of others. She inspires me with her generosity of spirit and her vision. Thank you, Martha, for being an amazing blessing in my life, and a true friend.</p>

<p class="container-paragraphs">I’ve been searching for God in my day to day life for most of my life. None of the teachers, books, or programs that I have explored over the years have come close to helping me know that connection in the way that Martha Burgess Novak and her Burgess Process does. Through her private sessions, lectures, CDs and group classes, I am finding my way to my own relationship with God. Martha facilitates with love, humor and great, good natured joy, teaching us how to come from Love, the God in each of us, in every relationship. What began as a personal quest has expanded into more deeply loving, happier relationships with my husband, our children, friends, and even the passing stranger. Our whole family works with the Burgess Process and has been transformed by it. Even those not directly working with Martha and her work respond to the changes in us and relationships change for the better. I can’t recommend Martha and this work highly enough!</p>

<p class="container-paragraphs">Martha was giving a leadership training course for AT&amp;T when I first met her. By the end of the day my back hurt so badly, I was lying on the floor. Martha looked down at me and asked me what I was doing. I told her I had chronic back problems. She said, "Come see me and I'll help you with that." Now I had sought help for my back from professionals for many years and nothing helped permanently. But I called the very next day. After working with Martha for a few short weeks, I was free of back pain and have stayed free of it for years now. I began taking her classes and was lucky enough to do weekly sessions and, shortly thereafter, I left AT&amp;T for a new career as a facilitator in her company. Martha Burgess Novak and The Burgess Process are life changers. They were for me and they will be for you.</p>

<p class="container-paragraphs">Martha Burgess Novak is simply the best. I knew the moment I saw her that she was the one to lead me on the journey. She safely takes you to the deepest understandings of yourself and your world, far beyond anything you ever could have imagined. And from there, you begin the life you want. It's inevitable in her presence and you will never look back. Ever. Simply the best.</p>

<p class="container-paragraphs">Martha is a brilliant teacher and this is the bottom line of every aspect of her work. She ignites a fire to learn about yourself, about the world and how to live in the fullest, most joyful, most productive and satisfying of ways. Even after nearly 8 years of working with Martha, I never cease to be amazed at her ability to inspire, and at her honesty and compassion; lessons are always growing deeper, never stagnant. She translates the language of universal truths into a usable language of the day-to-day and whether she is addressing one person or huge crowds, she has the ability to make everyone feel she is addressing only him or her. Working and learning with Martha has been exhilarating and the smartest and safest thing I've ever done. It changes life forever.</p>

<p class="container-paragraphs">Martha has transformed my life with her powerful energy work. She is love personified, radiant from the heart, wise, kind, intellectually brilliant and psychically gifted. I recommend her unequivocably.</p>

<p class="container-paragraphs">My wife has been into consciousness raising for years. I've accompanied her to this and that, and so I thought I was going along for another nice ride when she found Martha Burgess Novak and The Burgess Process. Right away, Martha and her work spoke to me as a man, as a husband, and as a father. I was truly blown away. Since that time, I have joined Martha in her classes, in her lectures, and in her private sessions. Her insight is amazing and she really does teach you how to live in joy, love, peace and harmony with ourselves, other people and our God. Martha doesn't just tell you "it's out there" for you. She gives you the practical, step by step approaches to get there, encouraging you fully along the way. I'd recommend her and this work to every man out there. Instead of waiting for your wives to initiate... this time, take your wives!</p>
