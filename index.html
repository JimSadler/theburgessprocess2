                <h3 class="page-header">Martha Burgess Novak Now a Writer for The Conscious Life Journal</h3>
                <p>Martha Burgess Novak has recently signed on as a columnist to write about greater consciousness for the new magazine, The Conscious Life Journal.  The magazine comes out six times a year and her column is
                    called Real Talk With Martha Burgess Novak.</p><p> "Hope Merrill, my publisher and I, had a good laugh over that title," Martha shares.  "Hope summed me up right away.  I'm a pretty straight shooter.  No
                    holding back with me so calling the column Real Talk seems to fit my personality. "I'm excited about this project," Martha states.  "It's a beautiful magazine.  Very polished with a lot of good
                    psychological articles.  Right up my alley.  I'm looking forward to the interaction with readership, a little different from the solitary writing I do for my books and the quick give-and- take of
                    radio. "What people can look forward to is what I always try to give:  how to use spiritual principles practically in daily life, what a privilege it is to use them, what the advantages are to using
                    them, what blocks our progress, and how to create the life you want through knowing yourself." The hardest part of writing a column like this?  "Keeping it near six hundred words.  Seems like a lot to
                    the uninitiated, but I can use six hundred words up just thinking about what I'm going to write over a good cup of tea!"</p>

                reality -- mystical peeks behind the ordinary, life-threatening moments that alter us forever, or a moment in nature of profound communion. The many revelations in this book take you behind the
                appearance of things, into the workings of energy and a radical perspective on the way things truly are. Call it enlightenment, greater consciousness or living in grace, it is a potential available
                to all.</p>
                <p>Martha Burgess Novak’s “The Life You Want” delves into the subject of greater consciousness and extraordinary, untapped human potential. This book will dismantle your old, limited beliefs about the
                    nature of who you are, the possibility of real love, and will give you answers from the perspective of how you use your energy to perpetuate the past rather than create a truly different present
                    and future. It will lead you to a new understanding of deeper realities which can actually be seen and understood, realities which are hidden beneath the surface of human relationships and
                    beneath every person's struggle to find meaning and happiness.</p>
                <p>The author has a unique capacity for translating complex concepts, offering practical approaches which you can immediately incorporate. She takes the stories of everyday life showing us how we trap
                    our energies as we hold onto the past, secured to the beliefs we conjured as children, remaining energetically hostage to images and ideas that were never even ours to begin with. Only when we
                    bring our energy into the present, do we live our lives passionately, joyously, creatively and far more lovingly according to our true nature. You can purchase Martha's book now on amazon.com,
                    kindle.com or at The Phoenix and Dragon Bookstore in Sandy Springs,GA.!</p>

                            conscious-raising new thought and the ascended energies that bring forth truth, choice and miracles. If you must miss a class, the classes are archived. the link to this archived version will be

                        <p class="editable" id="untitled-region-21">The emphasis of this class is on the deeply psychological wiring of the ego and the egoic child's mind. We analyze, facilitate healing, uncover deeply
                            buried, convoluted beliefs that limit us and help each other grow, change and become authentic as the spiritual beings in physical form we are. This class teaches and inspires and the vastness
                            of The Burgess Process and the varied techniques and powerful processes are revealed in this class. We say "over time" because we have a mass of material to cover, there's no way it can begin
                            to be covered in one class, and this is why this is an on-going class for the serious student of consciousness. Each quarter we pick up where we left off and each quarter we go deeper into
                            more esoteric, applicable study.</p>

            <div class="col-lg-12 editable" id="testi"><p class="container-paragraphs">She is a trustworthy and fearless guide for me on my journey to consciousness, with unwavering dedication to truth and lasting,
                positive change. Martha lives the simple, yet profound, message conveyed through her work. She has an extraordinary ability to bring ascended information and energy through to be integrated and experienced
                in the lives of others. She inspires me with her generosity of spirit and her vision. Thank you, Martha, for being an amazing blessing in my life, and a true friend.</p>

                <p class="container-paragraphs">I’ve been searching for God in my day to day life for most of my life. None of the teachers, books, or programs that I have explored over the years have come close to
                    helping me know that connection in the way that Martha Burgess Novak and her Burgess Process does. Through her private sessions, lectures, CDs and group classes, I am finding my way to my own
                    relationship with God. Martha facilitates with love, humor and great, good natured joy, teaching us how to come from Love, the God in each of us, in every relationship. What began as a personal
                    quest has expanded into more deeply loving, happier relationships with my husband, our children, friends, and even the passing stranger. Our whole family works with the Burgess Process and has
                    been transformed by it. Even those not directly working with Martha and her work respond to the changes in us and relationships change for the better. I can’t recommend Martha and this work highly
                    enough!</p>

                <p class="container-paragraphs">Martha was giving a leadership training course for AT&amp;T when I first met her. By the end of the day my back hurt so badly, I was lying on the floor. Martha looked down
                    at me and asked me what I was doing. I told her I had chronic back problems. She said, "Come see me and I'll help you with that." Now I had sought help for my back from professionals for many years
                    and nothing helped permanently. But I called the very next day. After working with Martha for a few short weeks, I was free of back pain and have stayed free of it for years now. I began taking her
                    classes and was lucky enough to do weekly sessions and, shortly thereafter, I left AT&amp;T for a new career as a facilitator in her company. Martha Burgess Novak and The Burgess Process are life
                    changers. They were for me and they will be for you.</p>

                <p class="container-paragraphs">Martha Burgess Novak is simply the best. I knew the moment I saw her that she was the one to lead me on the journey. She safely takes you to the deepest understandings of
                    yourself and your world, far beyond anything you ever could have imagined. And from there, you begin the life you want. It's inevitable in her presence and you will never look back. Ever. Simply the
                    best.</p>

                <p class="container-paragraphs">Martha is a brilliant teacher and this is the bottom line of every aspect of her work. She ignites a fire to learn about yourself, about the world and how to live in the
                    fullest, most joyful, most productive and satisfying of ways. Even after nearly 8 years of working with Martha, I never cease to be amazed at her ability to inspire, and at her honesty and compassion;
                    lessons are always growing deeper, never stagnant. She translates the language of universal truths into a usable language of the day-to-day and whether she is addressing one person or huge crowds, she
                    has the ability to make everyone feel she is addressing only him or her. Working and learning with Martha has been exhilarating and the smartest and safest thing I've ever done. It changes life
                    forever.</p>

                <p class="container-paragraphs">Martha has transformed my life with her powerful energy work. She is love personified, radiant from the heart, wise, kind, intellectually brilliant and psychically gifted.
                    I recommend her unequivocably.</p>

                <p class="container-paragraphs">My wife has been into consciousness raising for years. I've accompanied her to this and that, and so I thought I was going along for another nice ride when she found Martha
                    Burgess Novak and The Burgess Process. Right away, Martha and her work spoke to me as a man, as a husband, and as a father. I was truly blown away. Since that time, I have joined Martha in her classes,
                    in her lectures, and in her private sessions. Her insight is amazing and she really does teach you how to live in joy, love, peace and harmony with ourselves, other people and our God. Martha doesn't
                    just tell you "it's out there" for you. She gives you the practical, step by step approaches to get there, encouraging you fully along the way. I'd recommend her and this work to every man out there.
                    Instead of waiting for your wives to initiate... this time, take your wives!</p>
