                    sessions that she does in her hometown Atlanta and in cities around the world.</p>
                <p class="container-paragraphs editable" id="untitled-region-4">We invite you to work with Martha and the people she has trained. All go through a long, rigorous process to be certified. This group
                    of facilitators are top-notch professionals who have worked with Martha and with The Burgess Process for years. Martha is the real thing, a true motivator and inspirational leader as well as a
                    great teacher who cares deeply about people and about their journey into Wholeness. Her abilities are astounding and she continues to offer deep and life-altering insights the likes of which you
                    will never hear anywhere else.</p>

                <h3 class="page-header"> Writer for The Conscious Life Journal</h3>
                <p>Martha Burgess Novak has recently signed on as a columnist to write about greater consciousness for the new magazine, The Conscious Life Journal.  The magazine comes out six times a year and her column is
                    called Real Talk With Martha Burgess Novak.</p><p> "Hope Merrill, my publisher and I, had a good laugh over that title," Martha shares.  "Hope summed me up right away.  I'm a pretty straight shooter.  No
                    holding back with me so calling the column Real Talk seems to fit my personality. "I'm excited about this project," Martha states.  "It's a beautiful magazine.  Very polished with a lot of good
                    psychological articles.  Right up my alley.  I'm looking forward to the interaction with readership, a little different from the solitary writing I do for my books and the quick give-and- take of
                    radio. "What people can look forward to is what I always try to give:  how to use spiritual principles practically in daily life, what a privilege it is to use them, what the advantages are to using
                    them, what blocks our progress, and how to create the life you want through knowing yourself." The hardest part of writing a column like this?  "Keeping it near six hundred words.  Seems like a lot to
                    the uninitiated, but I can use six hundred words up just thinking about what I'm going to write over a good cup of tea!"</p>

                reality -- mystical peeks behind the ordinary, life-threatening moments that alter us forever, or a moment in nature of profound communion. The many revelations in this book take you behind the
                appearance of things, into the workings of energy and a radical perspective on the way things truly are. Call it enlightenment, greater consciousness or living in grace, it is a potential available
                to all.</p>
                <p>Martha Burgess Novak’s “The Life You Want” delves into the subject of greater consciousness and extraordinary, untapped human potential. This book will dismantle your old, limited beliefs about the
                    nature of who you are, the possibility of real love, and will give you answers from the perspective of how you use your energy to perpetuate the past rather than create a truly different present
                    and future. It will lead you to a new understanding of deeper realities which can actually be seen and understood, realities which are hidden beneath the surface of human relationships and
                    beneath every person's struggle to find meaning and happiness.</p>
                <p>The author has a unique capacity for translating complex concepts, offering practical approaches which you can immediately incorporate. She takes the stories of everyday life showing us how we trap
                    our energies as we hold onto the past, secured to the beliefs we conjured as children, remaining energetically hostage to images and ideas that were never even ours to begin with. Only when we
                    bring our energy into the present, do we live our lives passionately, joyously, creatively and far more lovingly according to our true nature. You can purchase Martha's book now on amazon.com,
                    kindle.com or at The Phoenix and Dragon Bookstore in Sandy Springs,GA.!</p>
