            Culled from the radio
            shows, teachings, writings and philosophy of Martha Burgess Novak, spiritual teacher, author,
            and lecturer, these answers will take you to the center of who you are as your Highest Self and,
            from an egoic perspective, they will challenge you to be more.</p>
          <p> Each message is teacup size, sometimes esoteric and sometimes triggering more than a little thought.
            Don’t be deceived by their size, these little tidbits, they pack a punch. Rest assured, it will
            be your message, just for you, made possible and brought to you by… you.</p>
          <p> Have fun with The Teacup Prophecies but take the messages seriously. God speaks to you through you
            and through all things and you’re the one who has picked up this book!</p>

          <p> ~ A note from the editor ~ </p>

          <p>The Teacup Prophecies is delightful! Your collection of thought-provoking quotes, taken from your
            lectures, offers something for every reader.

            As I edited the manuscript, I began thinking of people I knew who could benefit from reading it. Of course,
            I tucked away
            a golden nugget or two for myself, such as:</p>

          <p>
            <em> ~ “If you exercise your belief in futility, it will become stronger.” ~
              <br> ~ “Be willing to look in the dark places. The light switch is in there, and you have
              to feel around for it.” ~ </em>
          </p>
          <!-- <p>While the majority of the quotes are profoundly spiritual and serious, I enjoyed the humor of:
                                </p> -->
          <p>
            <em> ~ “Don’t wait for the next shoe to drop. You are holding that shoe over your head. Your arm
              should be tired by now. Put the shoe on your foot where it belongs, and get going!” ~</em>
          </p>
          <!-- <p>Other amusing quotes added a touch of levity while encouraging further reading:</p>
                            <p>
                                <em> ~ “The Good Book tells us not to cast pearls before swine. It isn’t that pigs are bad. It
                                    just means that they can’t appreciate fine jewelry.” ~ </em>
                            </p> -->

          <p> I think it’s safe to say that readers will have a difficult time putting The Teacup Prophecies
            down, as it is pleasant, relevant, and inspiring without being critical, condescending, or
            overbearing.
            The author has a unique capacity for translating complex concepts, offering practical approaches
            which you can immediately incorporate. She takes the stories of everyday life showing us
            how we trap our energies as we hold onto the past, secured to the beliefs we conjured as
            children, remaining energetically hostage to images and ideas that were never even ours to
            begin with. Only when we bring our energy into the present, do we live our lives passionately,
            joyously, creatively and far more lovingly according to our true nature.</p>

          <p class="container-paragraphs">Nothing is as it seems in this world. Many of us have had extraordinary
            experiences where we've glimpsed
            this reality -- mystical peeks behind the ordinary, life-threatening moments that alter us forever,
            or a moment in nature of profound communion. The many revelations in this book take you behind
            the appearance of things, into the workings of energy and a radical perspective on the way things
            truly are. Call it enlightenment, greater consciousness or living in grace, it is a potential
            available to all.</p>
          <p>Martha Novak’s “The Life You Want” delves into the subject of greater consciousness and extraordinary,
            untapped human potential. This book will dismantle your old, limited beliefs about the nature
            of who you are, the possibility of real love, and will give you answers from the perspective
            of how you use your energy to perpetuate the past rather than create a truly different present
            and future. It will lead you to a new understanding of deeper realities which can actually be
            seen and understood, realities which are hidden beneath the surface of human relationships and
            beneath every person's struggle to find meaning and happiness.</p>
