            <p class="editable" id="untitled-region-26"> Martha will be teaching an online
              basic format class to students who want to learn her amazing healing methodology. </p>
            <p class="editable" id="untitled-region-27">This class will introduce you to how energetic healings take
              place in this method.
              You will be emailed a basic format sheet that you will be used in many other classes should you decide to
              study further with
              Martha.</p>
            <p class="editable" id="untitled-region-28">In all honesty, this is a hard class. You will be stretched in
              this class and, make
              no mistake about it, you will not be an adept at format when you finish. This is just as it should be as
              this class is an
              introduction to your gifts and how to apply them in a very specific way. Through the years, students of
              ours have struggled
              with this class and mastered it in a few months, but it does take those few months of commitment and
              practice. </p>

            <p class="editable" id="untitled-region-29">There will be support classes to follow if this is the course of
              study you choose,
              all taught by Martha. She likes to know her students and watch their progress as the facilitator/healers
              in her organization
              come out of these classes.</p>
            <p class="editable" id="untitled-region-23">There is one prerequisite for these classes. You must be willing
              to work with one
              of Martha's facilitator/healers starting two weeks before the class begins and for the duration of the
              class. Of course,
              we hope you'll go on with your facilitator/healer after the class is over but this will be your choice.
              Count, in addition
              to the $695 cost of the class, another $150 a week for a full two hour session with one of the accredited
              facilitators/healers.</p>

                                for making you visible, being the base dynamic of all great leadership, and is the only energy level in which peak performance -- which is truly your potential -- can emerge from the
                                cells of the body. This is your most natural state and everything else is a distortion of this natural power.  Join us for a class that puts you in direct contact with this self of yours as
                                you learn about human potential. You'll also hear all about the way people learn and communicate and how to get to them when you recognize their specific style -- and yours. </p>
                            <p class="editable" id="untitled-region-27">We'll also be discussing the non-verbal language and what it is.  You might be surprised to learn that this is a language of energy, not body language,
                                and when you know what to look for and know what your own non-verbal language is doing, you make a flawless impression. Martha has successfully taught these techniques to businesses all over
                                North America.  The applications of this energy work are infinite and you'll not only carry skills from this course that you can implement immediately but these techniques will have
                                applications and impact on every aspect of your lives.</p>

                                    how advanced our program, this is the basic format to which we all return. It uproots old outworn ideas of ourselves, our world, our parents, our work, and our God, replacing these beliefs with
                                    conscious-raising new thought and the ascended energies that bring forth truth, choice and miracles. If you must miss a class, the classes are archived. the link to this archived version will be

            </p>
            <p class="editable" id="untitled-region-21">The emphasis of this class is on the deeply psychological wiring
              of the ego and the egoic child's mind. We analyze, facilitate healing, uncover deeply
              buried, convoluted beliefs that limit us and help each other grow, change and become authentic as the
              spiritual beings in physical form we are. This class teaches and inspires and the vastness
              of The Burgess Process and the varied techniques and powerful processes are revealed in this class. We say
              "over time" because we have a mass of material to cover, there's no way it can begin
              to be covered in one class, and this is why this is an on-going class for the serious student of
              consciousness. Each quarter we pick up where we left off and each quarter we go deeper into
              more esoteric, applicable study.</p>
            <p class="editable" id="untitled-region-22">It is possible for eager format students to audit this class. Be
              advised, however, this is a class we recommend you work up to through the other
              class offerings and your private sessions.</p>
