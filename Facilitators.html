                        <p class="bio-txt"> All my life I’ve been searching for answers, even as a child. Somewhere inside of me, I knew life had more love, joy, happiness, peace, and fulfillment in store for me than I have ever allowed.<br> While
                            I had accomplished things in life, nothing was ever enough. I read books, meditated, investigated different religions but nothing filled my emptiness. At age 56, my life as I had known it changed.
                            My 35 year marriage and business partnership was over.  In the chaos of this, I was miraculously led to Martha Burgess Novak (then Martha Burgess) who presented me with the questions I needed to be
                            asking and the new answers I needed to be considering.<br>
                            I have been studying with her now for almost ten years.  She does not train her people lightly and I have studied hard. Two years ago, I was privileged to become one of her master healers
                            and facilitators.<br>
                            I now use my experience in retail, entrepreneurship, and personal relationships to help others on their journey.</p>

                            Tracy has always been interested in consciousness studies as an avid reader and researcher, but true clarity was not found until she attended a Leadership Program at AT&T where Martha Burgess Novak
                            spoke. Tracy recognized Martha immediately as her teacher and started weekly sessions with her as well as participating in years of study in healing and spiritual development classes.  Tracy now works
                            full time as an intuitive and healing facilitator with Martha and works daily to be a clear channel for herself and her clients.  With the tools Tracy has to share with you, all things are possible.
