                        <u>The Process for Business</u>
                    </h3>

                    <p class="theprocesstxt">The Burgess Process defines a system of peak performance which allows people to generate high energy
                        on command without anxiety. Burgess' method of achieving peak performance energy far exceeds generic
                        business-seminar-style peak performance training. It renders visibility, bestows the dynamic of all
                        great leadership, and opens the door to consistantly high levels of accomplishment through peak perfromance
                        behaviors.
                    </p>

                    <p class="theprocesstxt">The Burgess Process delievers powerful, life-changing perpectives on peak performance, communication,
                        teamwork, sales, the power of perception, conflict management and resolution, and the inherent power
                        of non-verbal language. As a result, employees learn to achieve consistantly high levels of performance
                        on command.</p>

                    <h4 class="theprocess">
                        <u>Performance Training</u>
                    </h4>

                    <p class="theprocesstxt">Martha Burgess Novak,Inc. is a full-service firm dedicated to improving the executive, management, employee,
                        and customer experience. We teach companies, teams and individuals how to stand out and deliver a
                        high caliber performance in today's competitive marketplace.</p>

                    <p class="theprocesstxt">Most training organizations try to inspire teams. But company-wide growth cannot happen if the training
                        does not inspre the individuals to bring all of his or her talents to the table. A company's progress
                        begins with person-to-person improvement.</p>

                    <p class="theprocesstxt">Most of your business’ resources are quantitative. That’s how you measure profit. However, your business’
                        most valuable resources, people, are qualitative. How can you accurately measure their morale, their
                        enthusiasm for their work, their commitment to quality? That’s why businesses struggle to make worthwhile
                        investments in their most important assets – their employees.</p>

                    <p class="theprocesstxt">Martha Burgess inspires superior results. She reaches beyond conventional business coaching techniques
                        to reveal hidden blocks to higher achievement. She brings goals into focus and shows you the way
                        to achieve them. She assesses whole-company learning and communication capabilities, identifies and
                        shows you how to eliminate obstacles, and finally, creates an innovative, structured, customized
                        approach that propels every individual forward.</p>

                        <u>The Burgess Advantage</u>
                    </h3>

                    <p class="theprocesstxt">What is the difference between a good coach and a great one? Being a great coach requires out-of-the-box
                        thinking, exceptional insight and the ability to assess with neutrality. A great coach is an expert
                        communicator who links you to your potential. It’s easy to detect bad coaches: Their methods don’t
                        lead to the power of your potential. Instead, they ask you to imitate their potential.</p>

                    <p class="theprocesstxt">Martha Burgess Novak is an acknowledged innovator in training, coaching and development. She begins by
                        acknowledging that business behavior is human behavior – and that the highest goals for both are
                        the same: integrity, commitment, loyalty, truth, respect and honor.</p>

                    <p class="theprocesstxt">How does having a great coach benefit you? Growth is an adventure. By helping you identify and overcome
                        personal obstacles, a great coach does more than teach you to imitate behaviors that work for most
                        people. A great coach facilitates your evolution, ensuring that the training is effective and enduring.</p>

                    </h3>

                    <h5 class="theprocess"> I. Assessment and Process</h5>

                    <p class="theprocesstxt"> With her trademark evaluation, Martha Burgess Novak assesses the individual's learning and communication
                        process and provides companies with graphs of the results. We interpret the charts for you, teach
                        you how to interpret them for future use, and present the information to the company according to
                        your needs – suggesting the best team and/or job restructuring to management, running team comparisons,
                        assessing individual performance, predicting conflicts, and presenting solutions. Our Learning and
                        Communication Sequence (LCS) Assessments are an invaluable tool when hiring, merging, acquiring or
                        downsizing.
                    </p>

                    <h5 class="theprocess">II.Interview and Discovery</h5>

                    <p class="theprocesstxt"> Martha Burgess Novak,Inc. conducts extensive research before we begin. We interveiw, privately and confidentially,
                        anyone the company designates, including but not limited to its executive officers. We discover strenghts
                        and challenges, and devise efficient strategies to address each.</p>

                    <h5 class="theprocess">III. PPI Training and Systematic Access</h5>

                    <p class="theprocesstxt">Peak Performance Improvement (PPI) Training is a methodic approach, tailor-made to your organization
                        and its needs. Employee by employee, we show your company how to work at higher levels of performance.

                        your organization. We take the quickest route to help break old patterns that no longer serve your
                        organization and its goals, and train people to adopt more powerful behaviors. You’ll see performance
                        improve markedly, and immediately.</p>


                    <h5 class="theprocess">IV. Planning and Evaluation</h5>

                    <p class="theprocesstxt">After implementation of The Burgess Process, we sit down with you and determine how far you’ve come and
                        where you want to go next. At this time, we may conduct more interviews, survey your new image, or
                        design an itinerary that will guide you further on your journey, helping you choose and arrive at
                        the next, more ambitious destination.</p>

                            <u>The LCS</u>
                        </h3>

                        <p class="theprocesstxt">What the LCS is: it is an assessment of how one learns and communicates. It is based on the triunal
                            brain system, meaning that there are three parts of the brain that control three specific processes.
                            These three centers are measured by this assessment and the information determines a series of
                            unique learning and communication sequences that cut right to the heart of the individual and
                            how they are performing.</p>

                        <p class="theprocesstxt">There are some very fine personality tests out there on the market today that give you so much information
                            it is hard to weed through to the essentials of what you want to know about yourself and others.
                            The LCS is different. In a few hours, you are an expert, and in those same few hours, you have
                            the answers you've been seeking about yourself, your talents, gifts and abilities, your ability
                            to process mental, emotional and physical information, how fast you are in each of these areas,
                            what your inclinations are and how you will be inclined to behave in any given circumstance.
                            Employers will learn that the job they have to offer has an LCS and a successful hire is matching
                            the right candidate's LCS to the job's LCS. This assessment can also tell an employer who's going
                            to be the most productive, who can handle more stress without falling apart, who will work well
                            with others, keep a positive attitude, and what he can expect from this employee in a crisis.
                            This assessment shows what the individual's weaknesses and strengths are and how to minimize
                            and amplify them respectively. It will enhance extremely effective communication, eliminate misunderstandings
                            between people, deepen teamwork remarkably, lessen frustration in the workplace and much more.</p>
